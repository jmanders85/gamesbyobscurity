# Rare Gaming

A node script to generate some bbcode to post a list of games ordered by how obscure* they are to users of BoardGameGeek.com

*I am using the number of ratings votes to determine obscurity

for fun: Sheepshead is generally my most obscure, most played game by me with only 50 ratings votes.  By contrast, Carcassonne has over 75,000 ratings votes.
